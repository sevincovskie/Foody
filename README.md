1.Components
-Building blocks of React applications
-Can be functional or class-based

2.JSX
-JavaScript XML syntax
-Allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript

3.Props
-Properties passed to components
-Read-only and help make components reusable

4.State
-Internal data storage for components
-Can be updated and causes re-renders when changed

5.Hooks
-Functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components
-Examples: useState, useEffect, useContext

6.Virtual DOM
-Lightweight copy of the actual DOM
-Used for efficient updating and rendering

7.Render
-Process of displaying components on the screen
-Called when component mounts or updates

8.Lifecycle methods
-Special methods that run at different stages of a component's life
-Examples: componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount

9.Event handling
-Managing user interactions like clicks, input changes
-Uses camelCase naming convention

10.Conditional rendering
-Showing different content based on conditions
-Often uses ternary operators or logical AND (&&)

11.Lists and keys
-Rendering multiple similar elements
-Keys help React identify which items have changed

12.Context
-Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without props
-Useful for global state management

13.Higher-Order Components (HOC)
-Functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior
-Used for code reuse and logic abstraction

14.Ref
-Provides a way to access DOM nodes or React elements
-Useful for managing focus, animations, or integrating with third-party libraries

14.Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
-Controlled: Component state managed by React
-Uncontrolled: State managed by the DOM
